Black_mirror.exe – Black Hat Payload

Version: ........
Author: MØNSTR-M1ND
Target: Windows x64
Type: Firmware & System Destruction Suite

Overview

Black_mirror.exe is a high-impact destructive payload designed for deep system compromise. Once executed, the payload performs multiple layers of irreversible damage, targeting firmware, storage, and core system files. It bypasses conventional recovery methods and disables automatic repair mechanisms.

Destruction Sequence

Firmware Annihilation

Erases the UEFI bootloader (bootmgfw.efi) and critical HAL files.

Corrupts firmware recovery partitions.

Storage Obliteration

Writes pseudo-random data across the primary physical drive.

Corrupts MBR and partition tables, rendering the drive unusable.

System File Entropy Injection

Overwrites all files in C:\Windows\System32 with random data.

Breaks Windows Update components and core services.

Boot Death / Kernel Panic

Forces unrecoverable Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).

Prevents the system from booting even after repair attempts.

Final Sanitization

Triple-pass overwrite of all free space (cipher /w:C).

Format of primary volume (C:) with multiple overwrite passes.

Features

Direct hardware access bypasses Windows Defender and recovery mechanisms.

Survives system restore and reinstall attempts.

Disables automatic repair features and error reporting.

Post-execution results in permanent device damage if run on physical hardware.

Post-Detonation Effects

Permanent BSOD (UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME).

Erased UEFI bootloader and corrupted BIOS/UEFI settings.

Overwritten recovery partitions.

Permanent destruction of storage media sectors.

Note: This payload exceeds conventional malware destruction levels. Any system executed on will be permanently unusable without replacement hardware.
