# Black_mirror.exe – BlackHat MCA 4HKRS Payload

**Version:** ............................................................................................................0 
**Author:** MØNSTR-M1ND  
**Target:** Windows x64  
**Type:** Firmware & System Destruction Suite  

---

## Overview
**Black_mirror.exe** is a **high-impact destructive payload** designed for deep system compromise. Once executed, it performs multiple layers of irreversible damage, targeting firmware, storage, and core system files. It bypasses conventional recovery methods and disables automatic repair mechanisms.

## Destruction Sequence

1. **Firmware Annihilation**  
   - Erases the UEFI bootloader (`bootmgfw.efi`) and critical HAL files.  
   - Corrupts firmware recovery partitions.  

2. **Storage Obliteration**  
   - Writes pseudo-random data across the primary physical drive.  
   - Corrupts MBR and partition tables, rendering the drive unusable.  

3. **System File Entropy Injection**  
   - Overwrites all files in `C:\Windows\System32` with random data.  
   - Breaks Windows Update components and core services.  

4. **Boot Death / Kernel Panic**  
   - Forces unrecoverable Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).  
   - Prevents the system from booting even after repair attempts.  

5. **Final Sanitization**  
   - Triple-pass overwrite of all free space (`cipher /w:C`).  
   - Format of primary volume (`C:`) with multiple overwrite passes.

## Features

- Direct hardware access bypasses Windows Defender and recovery mechanisms.  
- Survives system restore and reinstall attempts.  
- Disables automatic repair features and error reporting.  
- Post-execution results in permanent device damage if run on physical hardware.  

---

## Post-Detonation Effects

- Permanent BSOD (`UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME`).  
- Erased UEFI bootloader and corrupted BIOS/UEFI settings.  
- Overwritten recovery partitions.  
- Permanent destruction of storage media sectors.  

> **Note:** This payload exceeds conventional malware destruction levels. Any system executed on will be permanently unusable without replacement hardware.
